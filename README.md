## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I believe this solution was the one that added the most so far.

I only knew the flex-box and in a very mediocre way. Today I see that there is much more to do, and many ways to make your CSS better, something that makes sense for the user and browser!

I had the opportunity to gain some affinity with CSS grid.



### Continued development

I intend to continue my study with the cube CSS methodology, I really liked it and I believe it brings much more meaning to what it means to code in CSS, I intend to improve my lines, more and more!
